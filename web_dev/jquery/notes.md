#jQuery Research Plan
* Seek out an overview, probably video. Aim for that to be less than 20 minutes
    - Ideally, do a little bit of initial coding alongside this... this might also be when I start working on a test html/css page so that I have something to work with while discovering the features of jQuery
* Look for cheat sheets/summaries of commonly-used features and save/bookmark them
* Try to use some of those features on a test page
* Look in to some more complex features/uses -- hopefully at this point I'll have a few keywords of what to look for and can potentially search out video overviews
    - Experiment with these features
